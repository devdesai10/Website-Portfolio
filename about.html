            I am passionate about creating with code. I have had experience with Python, Swift, HTML, R, CSS, and JavaScript. I am currently learning SQL to enhance my skills in manipulating databases. I enjoy creating and solving problems while coding. I love going from a empty file to a fully filled file.

          <p class="description">
